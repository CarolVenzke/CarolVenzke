- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm learning Japanese and Korean. I love cooking and trying new recipes.



As a Science Computer student I have some topics I'm learning at the moment:
- HTML,CSS and JS
- Python and Django
- Data Structures and Algorithms
- GIT

What I'm planning to learn in the near future:
  - SQlite (I had a basic introduction)
  - MySQL
  - Java

I could list a thousand thing that i still have to learn, and that's the beauty of this profession, we are always in a constant learning and growing process. I believe this is one of the keys to have a long life with a health mind.
Always beeing curious and ambicious with our learning is what keeps us motivate to continue to do a good work and dedicate ourselves to new knowledges.
